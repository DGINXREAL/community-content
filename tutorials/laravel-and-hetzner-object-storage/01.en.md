## Introduction

In this tutorial I'll show you how to use the Hetzner Object Storage with Laravel.

## Step 1 - Create your bucket

* Login into your Hetzner cloud dashboard from [https://console.hetzner.cloud]
* Goto `Object Storage`
* Click on `Create Bucket`
* Choose you location. ***Currently at creating this tutorial, only Falkenstein is available***
* Enter a name for your bucket. *In this Tutorial we will use `hetzner-tutorial-bucket` as example*
* Set the visibility.
* Click `Create & Buy Now`

## Step 2 - Create Hetzner Object Storage Access Keys

* Login into your Hetzner cloud dashboard from [https://console.hetzner.cloud]
* Goto `Security` and then on `S3-Credentials`
* Click on `Create Credentials`
* Enter a description like `projectLaravel`
* Now click on `Create`
* Copy `ACCESS KEY` and `SECRET KEY` to your clipboard

## Step 3 - Install composer dependencies for Laravel

Laravel needs the AWS SDK for PHP to access Hetzner Object Storage.

```bash
composer require league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3 "^3.0" --with-all-dependencies 
```

## Step 4 - Configure .env

We need to setup the `.env`-file.
Please replace the `HETZNER_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `HETZNER_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` from step 2 and replace the `HETZNER_S3_BUCKET`. 
Replace also the `HETZNER_S3_ENDPOINT` if more as Falkenstein is available.

```env 
HETZNER_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
HETZNER_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
HETZNER_S3_BUCKET=projectLaravel
HETZNER_S3_ENDPOINT=https://fsn1.your-objectstorage.com
```
## Step 5 - Update Filesystem config file

Open the `config/filesystems.php` in your Laravel project and add the code to the `disks`-array.

```php
return [
    "disks" => [
        //...existing disks
        'hetzner' => [
            'driver' => 's3',
            'key' => env('HETZNER_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
            'secret' => env('HETZNER_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
            'region' => 'us-east-1',
            'bucket' => env('HETZNER_S3_BUCKET'),
            'endpoint' => env('HETZNER_S3_ENDPOINT'),
            'use_path_style_endpoint' => true,
            'throw' => false,
            'visibility' => 'private',
        ]
    ]
]
